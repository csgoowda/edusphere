==================================================
EDUSPHERE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION
COMPONENT: FRONTEND
FILE: 01_overview.txt
==================================================

1. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
Framework: React.js
Language: TypeScript (TSX)
Styling: Vanilla CSS / Styled Components (TBD based on implementation)
Routing: React Router

2. CORE PRINCIPLES
--------------------------------------------------
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Strict separation of views for Students, Colleges, and Government officials.
- State Immutability: Visual states must reflect the "Locked" status of data.
- User Experience: "Submit Once" philosophy for colleges.

3. ROLE SEPARATION & PORTALS
--------------------------------------------------
A. PUBLIC PORTAL
   - Landing Page
   - Login / Registration
   - General Information

B. STUDENT DASHBOARD
   - View approved college data
   - Profile management
   - Read-only access to official records

C. COLLEGE DASHBOARD
   - Data Entry (Course details, Faculty, Infrastructure)
   - "Submit for Approval" workflow
   - Read-write until Locked -> Read-only after Submission

D. GOVERNMENT DASHBOARD
   - Verification queue
   - Approve / Reject / Request Correction actions
   - System-wide oversight

4. DATA FLOW PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------------------------------
Frontend acts as a presentation layer. No business logic regarding "Locking" or "Validation" is trusted on the client side; it mirrors the backend state.
All forms must check the `is_locked` status from the API before enabling editing.
