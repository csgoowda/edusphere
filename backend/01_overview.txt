EDUSPHERE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION
COMPONENT: BACKEND
FILE: 01_overview.txt
==================================================

1. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
Runtime: Node.js
Framework: Express.js (assumed standard for Node)
Database: SQLite (Relational)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

2. CORE RESPONSIBILITIES
--------------------------------------------------
- API Gateway for Frontend clients.
- Enforcer of the "One Submission" Rule.
- Management of the State Machine (PENDING -> APPROVED/REJECTED).
- File Storage management for college proofs/documents.

3. SECURITY & AUTHORIZATION LAYERS
--------------------------------------------------
A. AUTHENTICATION
   - Verifies identity (Student vs College vs Govt).
   - Issues Role-based tokens.

B. AUTHORIZATION MIDDLEWARE
   - Intercepts every write request.
   - Checks `is_locked` status for College users.
   - Allows specific transitions only for Government users.

4. API DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------------------------------
- RESTful standards.
- Response envelopes include status and data.
- Error handling must distinguish between "Validation Error" and "Workflow Violation" (e.g., trying to edit a locked record).

5. WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT
--------------------------------------------------
The backend is the specific guardian of the workflow.
- IF status == PENDING AND Actor == College: EDIT ALLOWED
- IF status == SUBMITTED AND Actor == College: EDIT DENIED (LOCKED)
- IF status == SUBMITTED AND Actor == Govt: REVIEW ACTIONS ALLOWED
